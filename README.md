# ThrottlingSystem
This is a basic API throttling system which serves HTTP request from the url http://localhost:7000
We are handling the request with Express.js module. Currently we have set for the maximum limit of 2 requests within 5 seconds.
We have used MongoDb for the data storage purpose. So we need mongo shell to make the connection to the DB.
The IDE used is Visual Studio.
